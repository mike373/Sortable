I have used python 3 to write this code, python 2 will not work
to run plication i called my program sortable_test.py with 3 arguments
the file containing the product listings, the file containing the listings, then the file to be created for output, results

python3 sortable_test.py products.txt listings.txt results.txt

I believe my code produces valid JSON and conforms to your spec
I would have made running it easier by hard-coding the files into the code
But it would make it more difficult to change the input files for examples not provided.
I tried to make my code as simple as possible explaining my steps with use of comments
to maintain the code i have broken it down into small functions and classes, to allow for easy of modifications
I balanced Precision with Recall to make sure I had a useful efficient solution
